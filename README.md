# Chat_Application_Description-

 Create a basic text-based chat application in Python where two users can exchange messages in real-time using the command line. Implement a simple client-server model for message exchange.

 ## Introduction 
 A chat room is an interface that allows two or more people to chat and send messages to everyone in the room. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple chat room server and allow multiple clients to connect to it using sockets in Python

 ## Key Concepts and Challenges:

 
1.Networking : Learn socket programming for real-time communication between clients and a server.

2.User Interface: Design an intuitive, responsive interface for the chat application.

## Demonstration
First, let's run one and only one server instance:
